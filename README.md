This tutorial summarizes details of the Joint Graphical Lasso (JGL) algorithm (Danaher et. al 2011), then walks through the steps needed to run the `JGL` package using a real-world metabolomics dataset.

To run this tutorial yourself, I recommend cloning [the repository](https://github.com/mljaniczek/jgl-tutorial) (click the green "CODE" button, then download the zip or open with GitHub Desktop), then opening the file `jgl-tutorial.Rproj` and running the code within that environment. Alternatively you can download the .csv file and .Rmd file and run them yourself. 

Ensure you have installed all the necessary packages to run this tutorial!

```
#install.packages("JGL")
#install.packages("igraph", "RColorBrewer", "pheatmap")
